# Scientific Calculator

## Project Name
**Scientific Calculator**  
A feature-rich scientific calculator application built with WPF and C# 7.0, offering basic and advanced mathematical operations with a modern UI.

## Objective
To create a fully functional scientific calculator that provides both standard and advanced mathematical functions while demonstrating clean code practices and proper software architecture.

## Purpose
This project serves as a comprehensive implementation of a scientific calculator with the following capabilities:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ร, รท)
- Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, ln, etc.)
- Second function capabilities (inverse operations)
- Radian/Degree mode switching
- Clean, modern UI with proper theming
- Window customization (borderless with drag functionality)

**Date of creation**: 2023-11  
**Technical**: C# 7.0, WPF, .NET Framework  
**Laboratory**: Visual Studio 2022
